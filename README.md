# Tic-Tac-Toe
Hello there!

Join me as I continue my Full Stack JavaScript Path with TOP!

I recently completed the Library project, which served as a refresher in creating dynamic web pages using HTML, CSS, and JS. It was a challenge, but I persevered!

Having overcome that hurdle, I now feel confident in my understanding of objects, constructors, inheritance, and how to apply this knowledge to an actual project.

In our current endeavor, we will utilize the factory pattern, module pattern, and my newly acquired understanding of private variables, functions, and closures to build this game.

While I have ambitious plans to develop an AI with different difficulty levels, for now, my focus will be on building a functional UI that allows you to play the game with a friend locally.
